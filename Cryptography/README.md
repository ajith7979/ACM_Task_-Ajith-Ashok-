Chinese Remainder Theorem
The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if you have a system of congruences with pairwise coprime moduli, there exists a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli. This theorem is useful in cryptography for combining results from different keys.

Implementation
I researched the CRT using ChatGPT and developed this code to apply the theorem. After running the code, I successfully retrieved the original message:
